## *THE ADMINISTRATOR IS DEAD.*

A TF2 Mod that ports the UI seen in ULTRAKILL by Arsi "Hakita" Patala.
Features completely reworked menus and HUD faithful to ULTRAKILL.

## *AUSTRALIUM IS FUEL.*

ULTRAHUD features a variety of color customizations to alter the look and feel of the HUD, with a variety of possible color combinations.
There also exists a modular streamer mode, to hide whatever you need to. The main menu background can be customized between many of the official album art seen in ULTRAKILL (and some fanmade ones!).
